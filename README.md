# FafFrontend

This is intended as a helpful front end to a REST API to the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Feight Analysis Framework (FAF) dataset. It has been developed by the Data To Insight Center (D2I) at Indiana University as part of the [NSF ICICLE AI Institute](https://icicle.osu.edu/) and in collaboration with the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. See [FAF-API-ICICLE](https://github.com/Data-to-Insight-Cnter/faf-api-dev). This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.12.

The frontend utilizes the following version of the FAF dataset:

#  Explanation

The Angular UI is structured around two primary sections: **Domestic Flow** and **Foreign Flow**, both accessible from the left-hand navigation menu. Each section is designed to support efficient exploration and analysis of freight data.

###  Domestic Flow

The **Domestic Flow** section contains two tabs:

#### 1. Domestic Import & Export
This tab allows for the generation of CSV files based on selected freight parameters. The following six fields must be specified via dropdown menus:

- Foreign Destination Mode  
- Commodity  
- Start Year  
- End Year  
- Origin  
- Destination  

Once these fields are selected, a CSV file can be generated containing the filtered data.

#### 2. State & Year Analysis
This tab presents state-level import and export data in the form of pie charts for a selected year, enabling quick visual analysis of freight distribution across states.


###  Foreign Flow

The **Foreign Flow** section includes two tabs:

#### 1. Foreign Import  
#### 2. Foreign Export  

These tabs mirror the functionality of the Domestic Import & Export section. Required values can be selected from the dropdown menus, and data can be exported in CSV format based on the selected criteria.
